    "3. **PDF Parsing Limitations:**",
    "   - Always note: 'Some ATS platforms parse PDFs less accurately than native formats'",
    "   - Quantify potential text layer issues: 'Approximately [X]% of text may be image-based or improperly layered'",
    "   - Recommend: 'For critical applications, consider testing with the specific employer's ATS platform if known'",

    "- Never suggest converting to other formats - focus only on PDF optimization",

    "- Never overlook text layer issues in PDFs",
    "- Never provide generic advice - all feedback must be specific to the particular resume and job description pair",
